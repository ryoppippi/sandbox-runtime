/**
 * Credential file masking (Linux).
 *
 * For a `credentials.files` entry with `mode: "mask"`, srt reads the real
 * file content on the host, registers one or more sentinels in the
 * {@link SentinelRegistry}, and writes a fake file (sentinel-substituted)
 * to a manager-owned temp directory. The Linux sandbox then `--ro-bind`s
 * the fake over the real path, so the sandboxed process reads the
 * sentinel(s). The proxy substitution from env-var masking already scans
 * every header for any registered sentinel, so a tool that does
 * `Authorization: Bearer $(cat <maskedFile>)` reaches the upstream with
 * the real bytes — no proxy changes required.
 *
 * Without `extract`, masking is **whole-file**: one sentinel replaces the
 * entire content. With `extract`, masking is **structured**: a regex picks
 * out the credential value(s) and only those spans are replaced, so a tool
 * that parses the file (JSON/YAML/.netrc) still sees valid syntax. See
 * {@link extractAndSubstitute} and {@link CredentialFileConfigSchema}.
 *
 * On macOS, SBPL cannot redirect reads, so masked files degrade to
 * `mode: "deny"` (see macos-sandbox-utils.ts).

 *
 * Offset-based: the regex `d` flag exposes capture-group offsets, so the

 * regex-matched span is replaced — a captured value that coincidentally
 * appears elsewhere in the file (outside any match) is left intact. No

 *
 * With `maskDuplicates` (see {@link ExtractOptions}), an indexOf scan
 * additionally collects every verbatim occurrence of each captured value
 * elsewhere in the file. All spans are computed against the ORIGINAL
 * content — never the partially substituted output — so an inserted
 * sentinel can never be re-matched and corrupted, even when a captured
 * value is a substring of the sentinel literal. Regex-match spans win
 * over verbatim ones, and verbatim scans run longest-capture-first so a
 * shorter capture that is a substring of a longer one cannot claim part
 * of the longer secret's occurrence.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the pattern matches nothing — the caller routes
 * that per the entry's `onExtractNoMatch` option (warn / deny / error;
 * see {@link buildMaskedFileBinds}).
 *
 * Throws when a match has no group-1 capture. The schema already rejects
 * patterns with zero groups, so this only fires when group 1 is optional
 * and absent for some match (e.g. `"token: (\\S+)?"`); accepting that
 * would silently mask nothing for that occurrence.
 *
 * Pure on `content`/`pattern`; the callback may close over a registry.
